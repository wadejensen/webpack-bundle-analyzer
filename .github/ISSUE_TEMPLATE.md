#### Debug info
How do you use this module? As CLI utility or as plugin?

If CLI, what command was used? (e.g. `webpack-bundle-analyzer -O path/to/stats.json`)

If plugin, what options were provided? (e.g. `new BundleReportPlugin({ analyzerMode: 'disabled', generateStatsFile: true })`)

What other Webpack plugins were used?

It would be nice to also attach webpack stats file.
It can be generated using these options:
```js
new BundleReportPlugin({
  analyzerMode: 'disabled',
  generateStatsFile: true,
  // Excludes module sources from stats file so there won't be any sensitive data
  statsOptions: { source: false }
})`
```
`stats.json` will be created in Webpack bundle output directory.
